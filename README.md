#Poll management application

- A PHP-based poll management application with user authentication and administrative features. Implemented various features such as poll creation, voting, and results display,
     as well as user registration and login functionality and many more. Utilized JSON files to store poll, user, and vote data. Designed the user interface to be visually appealing and responsive on a variety of screen sizes.
    This project helped me to improve my skills in PHP.
